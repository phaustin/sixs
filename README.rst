Python bindings for `6s <http://6s.ltdri.org/>`_. The 6S code is a basic RT code used for calculation of lookup tables in the MODIS atmospheric correction algorithm. These bindings were developed in the framework of the `EOLDAS project <http://www.assimila.eu/eoldas/>`_. These bindings include the fortran code from `here <http://6s.ltdri.org/>`_ for convenience.
